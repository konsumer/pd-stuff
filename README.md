# pure-data patches

This is a random collection of puredata patches. I use [purr-data](https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/) for easy setup/indtall. I try to make a `-help` patch for all of them. You can open this directly for an example, or later get a refreshr on how to use it by adding the patch you want to your thing, then right-click and choose "Help".

## scalegen

This is a little piano that lets you select a pool of notes, and it will fire them when you send it a trigger. You can use this to make nice random music in scales and things.

## banger

This is just a simple `metro` with bpm on it.
