# pure-data patches

This is my small collection of puredata patches for general use. I use [purr-data](https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/) for easy setup/install, which you might need to get all the pd extensions. There is a `-help` patch for all of these. You can open this directly for an example, or later get a refresher on how to use it by adding the patch you want to your thing, then right-click and choosing "Help". You can also open demo.pd to check most of them out.

This is a little piano that lets you select a pool of notes, and it will fire them when you send it a trigger. You can use this to make nice random music in scales and things.

## banger

This is just a simple `metro` with bpm on it.

## indicatator

This just indicates current step.

## numpat
